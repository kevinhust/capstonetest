## **AI Capstone: Milestone 2 Check-in (Week 6\)**

**Focus:** Demonstrating progress on data handling, feature engineering, and showing initial working code for baseline models or core system prototypes.

**Requirements & Discussion Points:**

Students should be prepared to discuss and demonstrate:

1. **Data Status:**  
   * Demonstrate the cleaned/prepared dataset(s). Discuss the cleaning/preprocessing steps undertaken.  
   * Show examples of generated data if simulation was used.  
   * Discuss any challenges encountered during data preparation and how they were addressed.  
2. **Feature Engineering (If Applicable):**  
   * What features have been created or selected?  
   * Explain the rationale behind these features.  
3. **Baseline Model / Core Prototype:**  
   * **Demonstrate runnable code** for at least a baseline ML model (e.g., Logistic Regression, simple CNN, basic clustering) trained on the prepared data OR  
   * **Demonstrate runnable code** for a core component prototype (e.g., a basic Flask/FastAPI endpoint structure that accepts dummy data, a basic Dash/Streamlit dashboard layout with placeholder data/plots).  
   * Discuss initial results or functionality. What worked? What didn't?  
4. **Updated Technical Approach:**  
   * Have any initial technology choices changed based on experience so far? Why?  
   * Refined view on the specific models/algorithms to pursue next.  
5. **Progress & Planning:**  
   * Review progress against the plan set in Milestone 1\.  
   * Detailed task breakdown for the *next 3 weeks* (leading to Milestone 3), focusing on core model development and integration.  
   * Any adjustments to team roles or workflow.  
   * Revised assessment of risks.

**Marking Scheme (Informal Discussion-Based Assessment \- Total 20 points)**

* **1\. Data Preparation & Handling (4 points):**  
  * (0-1) Data still messy or unusable; major issues unresolved.  
  * (2-3) Data is mostly clean/prepared; minor issues remain or process could be clearer.  
  * (4) Data is well-prepared, cleaning steps clearly explained and justified; simulation (if used) is reasonable.  
* **2\. Feature Engineering Rationale (If Applicable) (3 points):**  
  * (0) Not applicable or features seem random/unjustified.  
  * (1-2) Some features created/selected; rationale is partially explained.  
  * (3) Features are relevant; clear justification provided for choices.  
* **3\. Demonstrable Code Progress (Baseline/Prototype) (5 points):**  
  * (0-1) No runnable code or significant errors preventing demonstration.  
  * (2-3) Basic code runs but is minimal or has noticeable issues; demonstration is shaky.  
  * (4-5) Clear demonstration of a working baseline model or core prototype; code is understandable; initial results/functionality discussed.  
* **4\. Technical Adaptability & Understanding (3 points):**  
  * (0-1) Sticking rigidly to initial plan despite issues OR changes lack clear reasoning.  
  * (2) Some adaptation shown or understanding of next technical steps is adequate.  
  * (3) Thoughtful adjustments to technical plan based on experience; clear understanding of next modeling/development steps.  
* **5\. Planning & Progress Review (3 points):**  
  * (0-1) Little progress evident; plan for next phase is vague.  
  * (2) Reasonable progress made; plan for next 3 weeks is outlined.  
  * (3) Good progress demonstrated; detailed and realistic plan for Milestone 3 presented.  
* **6\. Professionalism & Collaboration (2 points):**  
  * (0) Poor preparation or clear lack of collaboration within the group.  
  * (1) Group shows adequate preparation and seems to be collaborating.  
  * (2) Group is well-prepared, communicates effectively, evidence of strong collaboration.

**Feedback:** Verbal feedback will focus on the quality of the data work, the feasibility of the prototype/baseline, and the realism of the plan for core development.
