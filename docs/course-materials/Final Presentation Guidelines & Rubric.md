## **AI Capstone: Final Presentation Guidelines & Rubric**

**Focus:** A concise, engaging, and professional presentation summarizing the capstone project for an audience including the instructor and potentially peers or industry guests. The presentation should include a live demonstration of the final system.

**Format & Timing:**

* **Duration:** Typically 15-20 minutes presentation \+ 5-10 minutes Q\&A  
* **Format:** Slide-based presentation (e.g., PowerPoint, Google Slides) combined with a **live demonstration** of the project.  
* **Audience:** Assume a technically knowledgeable audience familiar with core AI concepts but not necessarily the specific details of your project beforehand.

**Expected Content & Structure:**

1. **Title Slide:** Project Title, Student Names, Course Name.  
2. **Introduction (1-2 slides):**  
   * Briefly introduce the team.  
   * Hook: What is the problem? Why is it interesting/important?  
   * Project Goal/Objectives: What did you set out to achieve?  
   * Quick overview of the presentation structure.  
3. **Background/Motivation (1-2 slides):**  
   * Necessary context or brief mention of related work.  
4. **Methodology/Approach (3-5 slides):**  
   * High-level overview of the data used.  
   * Key techniques/models employed (focus on *what* and *why*, not deep math unless crucial).  
   * System Architecture Overview (a clear diagram is essential).  
   * Key technologies used (libraries, frameworks, cloud services).  
5. **LIVE DEMONSTRATION (Crucial: 5-7 minutes):**  
   * **Show the system working\!**  
     * *API Project:* Use Postman, curl, or a simple script to hit the deployed endpoint and show input/output.  
     * *Dashboard Project:* Navigate the deployed dashboard, highlighting key features and visualizations.  
     * *Pipeline Project:* Show the CI/CD interface, trigger a run (or show a recent successful run), point out key steps, show the registered model/deployed artifact.  
     * *Other Projects:* Walk through the core functionality step-by-step.  
   * Explain what is happening during the demo. Keep it smooth and focused. **Practice this extensively\!** Have a backup plan (e.g., video recording) in case of technical failure, but the live demo is preferred.  
6. **Results & Key Findings (2-3 slides):**  
   * Summarize the main results and performance metrics. Use clear visuals.  
   * What were the most interesting or significant findings?  
7. **Discussion & Conclusion (2-3 slides):**  
   * Were the objectives met?  
   * Key challenges and limitations.  
   * Potential future work or impact.  
   * Concluding remarks: Summarize the project's value and achievements.  
8. **Thank You & Q\&A Slide:** Include contact info or repo link (optional).

| Criterion | Excellent (Highest Point Range) | Good (Mid-High Point Range) | Fair (Mid-Low Point Range) | Poor (Lowest Point Range) | Points |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **1\. Introduction & Problem Definition** | Highly engaging start, crystal-clear problem definition, motivation, and objectives. Sets the stage perfectly. | Clear explanation of problem, motivation, and objectives. Good start. | Problem/motivation/objectives somewhat unclear or presented dryly. | Fails to clearly define the problem, motivation, or objectives. Confusing start. | **/ 10** |
| **2\. Methodology & Technical Explanation** | Clear, concise explanation of approach, architecture (with excellent diagram), and technologies with strong justification. Perfect technical depth. | Clear explanation of approach, architecture (with diagram), and technologies with adequate justification. Appropriate technical depth. | Explanation lacks clarity or justification. Architecture diagram unclear/missing. Technical depth may be too high/low. | Methodology/technical aspects are confusing, poorly explained, or missing. No justification. | **/ 20** |
| **3\. Live Demonstration** | Flawless, smooth demo effectively showcasing core functionality and outcome. Confident delivery. Excellent preparedness (backup visible/ready if needed). | Clear demo showcasing most core functionality. Minor hiccups handled well. Good preparedness (backup plan likely exists). | Demo is partially successful but buggy, slow, or struggles to show core functionality. Presenter seems unprepared. Backup plan may be absent or not ready. | Demo fails significantly, does not show core functionality, or presenter cannot operate the system. Lack of preparedness evident. No backup plan. | **/ 30** |
| **4\. Results & Analysis** | Key results presented with highly effective visuals. Insightful analysis clearly explained. | Key results presented clearly with good visuals. Solid analysis explained well. | Results presented but visuals are unclear or ineffective. Analysis is superficial or explanation lacks clarity. | Results are missing, confusing, or inaccurate. No meaningful analysis presented. | **/ 15** |
