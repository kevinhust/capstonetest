## **AI Capstone: Milestone 1 Check-in (Week 3\)**

**Focus:** Solidifying the project scope, understanding the data landscape, planning the technical approach, and establishing a clear project roadmap.

**Requirements & Discussion Points:**

Students should be prepared to discuss and informally present the following:

1. **Refined Project Charter:**  
   * Any modifications made to the initial project idea (scope adjustments, clarified objectives).  
   * Clear articulation of the problem they are solving and the project's goal.  
   * Confirmation of In-Scope and Out-of-Scope items.  
2. **Data Acquisition & Initial Exploration:**  
   * What data sources have been identified and accessed? (Show links, describe datasets).  
   * What are the initial findings from exploring the data? (e.g., data formats, key fields, potential quality issues, volume).  
   * What is the plan for data cleaning and preprocessing?  
   * If using simulated data, what is the plan for generation?  
3. **Proposed Technical Approach:**  
   * What specific ML models, algorithms, or techniques are being considered? Why?  
   * What technologies (programming languages, libraries, frameworks) will be used? (e.g., Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Flask/FastAPI, Docker, specific cloud services). Justify choices.  
   * Initial thoughts on system architecture (e.g., data flow, API structure, dashboard components).  
4. **Project Plan & Team Roles:**  
   * Detailed task breakdown for the *next 3 weeks* (leading to Milestone 2).  
   * Initial assignment of roles and responsibilities within the group.  
   * Identification of potential risks or roadblocks and initial mitigation ideas.  
5. **Questions & Challenges:**  
   * What questions do you have? What challenges are you anticipating?

**Marking Scheme (Informal Discussion-Based Assessment \- Total 15 points)**

* **1\. Clarity of Project Definition (3 points):**  
  * (0-1) Scope/goals are vague or unrealistic.  
  * (2) Scope/goals are mostly clear but need minor refinement.  
  * (3) Scope/goals are well-defined, clear, and seem achievable.  
* **2\. Data Understanding & Plan (3 points):**  
  * (0-1) Data sources unclear or initial exploration is minimal; weak plan.  
  * (2) Data sources identified, some exploration done; basic cleaning/prep plan exists.  
  * (3) Clear understanding of data sources, good initial exploration insights; solid plan for cleaning/prep/simulation.  
* **3\. Technical Approach & Justification (3 points):**  
  * (0-1) Technology choices seem arbitrary or inappropriate; approach unclear.  
  * (2) Plausible technology choices and approach, but justification could be stronger.  
  * (3) Well-reasoned technology choices and technical approach clearly articulated.  
* **4\. Project Planning & Risk Awareness (3 points):**  
  * (0-1) Next steps unclear; minimal task breakdown or risk identification.  
  * (2) Basic plan for next milestone exists; some thought given to risks.  
  * (3) Detailed, realistic plan for next 3 weeks; roles considered; key risks identified with mitigation ideas.  
* **5\. Professionalism & Engagement (3 points):**  
  * (0-1) Group seems unprepared, disengaged, or struggles to articulate progress.  
  * (2) Group is generally prepared and engaged, answers questions reasonably well.  
  * (3) Group is well-prepared, actively engaged, communicates clearly, asks thoughtful questions.

**Feedback:** Verbal feedback will be provided immediately during/after the discussion, focusing on strengths and areas for improvement leading into the next milestone.
