### 1. Executive Summary

#### 1.1 Product Vision
The **Personal Health Butler AI** is a streamlined, AI-powered nutrition-focused assistant that leverages **Multi-Agent Architecture** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to deliver personalized, evidence-based wellness guidance. Users upload meal photos, and the system analyzes food, provides calorie/macro breakdowns, and offers simple follow-up diet/exercise suggestions grounded in reliable knowledge sources.

#### 1.2 Problem Statement
Current health apps often provide generic or ungrounded advice, lack integration across nutrition and fitness, and fail to deliver quick, visual-input-based insights. This MVP addresses these by focusing on **meal photo analysis** with trustworthy, cited recommendations.

#### 1.3 Proposed Solution (MVP)
A Multi-Agent system with:
- Coordinator routing user inputs
- Nutrition Agent for photo-based analysis + RAG-grounded advice
- Fitness Agent for simple follow-up suggestions
- Streamlit UI for seamless interaction
- Strict focus on nutrition domain for depth and reliability

- **RAG Knowledge Pipeline**: Nutrition-focused vector DB (FAISS) with retrieval and grounding
- **Food Recognition**: ViT-based classification (HuggingFace `nateraw/food-vit-101`) from uploaded images
- **Nutrition Analysis**: Calorie/macro estimation + evidence-based dietary suggestions
- **Streamlit Dashboard**: User interface for photo upload, text queries, session management, and evidence display
- **Simple User Profile/Session**: Basic goals/preferences stored ephemerally

#### 2.2 Out-of-Scope (Phase 2 or Future Extensions)
- Mental Health Agent

## 7. Development Approach (Recommended: Modular + Iterative)

#### Why Modular & Iterative (instead of Waterfall)?

The project adopts a **modular + iterative development approach** rather than a traditional linear waterfall model. This is better suited for AI/ML-heavy capstone projects because:

- AI components (YOLO fine-tuning, RAG quality, agent coordination) require experimentation and frequent iteration.
- Modules can be developed and tested independently, reducing integration risks.
- Allows parallel work by 4 team members, with clear ownership and early feedback.
- Aligns with 2026 AI development best practices (e.g., build independent components first, integrate late).

#### Module Breakdown & Ownership

The system is decomposed into highly decoupled modules. Each module has:

- Clear input/output interface
- Independent test/demo script
- Mini-milestone for validation

| Module Name                      | Owner                        | Primary Deliverable (Independent)                            | Dependencies (Minimal)               | Target Completion |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| 1. Data & RAG Pipeline           | Wangchuk                     | USDA/Open Food Facts data ingestion, chunking, FAISS index, simple retrieval demo | None                                 | Week 2–4          |
| 2. CV / Food Recognition         | Wangchuk                     | YOLO26 baseline, Food-101 download, inference script (image → JSON foods list) | None                                 | Week 2–5          |
| 3. Nutrition Agent               | Wangchuk (lead) + Aziz (RAG) | YOLO output + RAG → nutrition analysis & suggestions (standalone script) | Module 1 & 2 outputs (mock OK)       | Week 4–6          |
| 4. Fitness Agent                 | Kevin                        | User profile + nutrition input → exercise suggestions (rule-based + RAG) | Mock nutrition input                 | Week 4–6          |
| 5. Coordinator & Orchestration   | Allen                        | LangGraph graph, intent routing, response synthesis (with dummy agents first) | Agent interfaces                     | Week 5–7          |
| 6. Streamlit UI + Session        | Wangchuk + Allen             | Photo upload, chat interface, evidence display, ephemeral session | Single agent first, then Coordinator | Week 6–8          |
| 7. Full Integration & Deployment | Allen (lead) + All           | End-to-end flow, latency testing, Cloud Run deployment, 3 demo scenarios | All modules                          | Week 8–10         |

#### Interface Contracts (To Be Defined in Week 1–2)

All modules will follow agreed JSON/Pydantic interfaces to ensure loose coupling. Examples:

- ViT Output: {"foods": [{"name": "pizza", "confidence": 0.92}]}
- RAG Output: [{"content": "str", "source": "USDA", "score": 0.85}]
- Agent Input/Output: Standardized run(input_dict) → output_dict

#### Key Practices for Success

- **Weekly Sync**: 30-min Discord every Sunday → each member demos their module progress (screenshot/video).

- **Mocking**: Use dummy data/outputs during early development to avoid blocking.

- **Testing**: Each module has its own test script (pytest or simple main block).

- **Repo Structure** (suggested):

  text

  ```
  src/
  ├── data_rag/          # Aziz
  ├── cv_food_rec/       # Wangchuk
  ├── agents/
  │   ├── nutrition/     # Wangchuk + Aziz
  │   └── fitness/       # Kevin
  ├── coordinator/       # Allen
  └── ui_streamlit/      # Wangchuk + Allen
  ```

- **Milestone Alignment**:

  - MS1 (Week 3): Module breakdown diagram + first baselines (ViT inference, RAG retrieval demo)
  - MS2 (Week 6): All individual prototypes running independently
  - MS3 (Week 9): Partial integration (e.g., Nutrition chain complete)
  - MS4 (Week 12): Full system + deployment

This approach minimizes risk, maximizes parallel progress, and ensures tangible deliverables at every milestone.
