# Local Docker Deployment Verification

We have successfully completed local Docker deployment testing for the Health Butler Discord bot. This ensures the bot is ready for Cloud Run recruitment and production usage.

## Key Fixes & Improvements

### 1. Bot Startup & Stability
- **Fixed Crash**: Moved `change_presence` calls from `setup_hook` to `on_ready`. This prevents the `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'change_presence'` that occurred because the WebSocket wasn't ready.
- **Lazy Loading**: Refactored `VisionTool` and `RagTool` to load heavy models (YOLOv8 and SentenceTransformers) only when first needed. This ensures the bot starts up instantly and responds to health checks within the first few seconds.

### 2. Localization & Premium Onboarding
- **English-Only Interface**: All bot communications and system messages are localized to English.
-### 🚀 Premium UI Flow (5-Step Comprehensive)
We've implemented a professional, high-fidelity registration experience using chained Discord components:

1.  **Welcome**: `/demo` triggers a clean welcome message with a green **"Start Setup"** button.
2.  **Step 1 (Modal)**: Collects Basic Info (**Name, Age, Gender, Height, Weight**).
3.  **Step 2 (Select)**: Interactive menu for **Health Goals**.
4.  **Step 3 (Multi-Select)**: **Health Conditions** for Phase 5 safety integration.
5.  **Step 4 (Select)**: **Activity Level** (Sedentary to Extra Active).
6.  **Step 5 (Multi-Select)**: **Dietary Preferences** (Vegetarian, Vegan, Keto, etc.).
7.  **Final Summary**: A beautiful summary card displays the full profile and activates **Demo Mode**.

> [!NOTE]
> This flow ensures high data quality for personalized AI recommendations while maintaining an engaging 90-second onboarding experience.
- **Consolidated Secrets**: All essential secrets (`DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, etc.) are now centrally managed in the root `.env` file and correctly passed to the container.
- **Port Mapping**: Local port conflict (with Redpanda) was resolved by mapping container port `8080` to host port `8085`.

## Verification Results

### Health Check Proof
The bot now successfully reports health status via the internal server:

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "uptime_seconds": 6,
  "bot_connected": true,
  "timestamp": "2026-02-12T00:41:32.064224"
}
```

### Logs Summary
Initialization is smooth and non-blocking:
1. `🏥 Initializing Health Butler Swarm...`
2. `VisionTool initialized (Lazy Loading enabled)`
3. `RagTool initialized (Lazy Loading enabled)`
4. `✅ Bot logged in as aig200capstone#4631`
5. `📊 Connected to 1 guild(s)`

## Next Steps
With local Docker testing verified, we can now proceed to finalizing the Cloud Run deployment via the GitHub Actions pipeline.
