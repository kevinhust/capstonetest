**Subject:** Proposal for Custom AI Capstone Project: Personal Health Butler AI - Group 5

**Dear Professor Amit,**

We are **Group 5** from the AI Capstone course, and we are writing to formally propose a custom project idea for our capstone. Our group members are: **Aziz Rahman, Tsering Wangchuk Sherpa, Mingxuan Li, and Zhihuai Wang**.

After reviewing the provided project charters, we would like to propose a custom project titled **"Personal Health Butler AI."** We have designed this project to match the scope and complexity of the provided charters, ensuring it covers the full AI lifecycle and utilizes multiple advanced AI domains.

**Project Overview:**
The "Personal Health Butler" is a sophisticated, multimodal AI ecosystem designed for personalized wellness management. Unlike standard fitness apps, our system utilizes a **Multi-Agent Architecture** to orchestrate specialized tasks and employs **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to provide evidence-based health advice grounded in verified domain knowledge.

**Technical Complexity & Innovation:**
To ensure this project meets the high standards of the Capstone program, we plan to integrate the following advanced components:

- 
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration:** Powered by specialized agents (Nutritionist, Fitness Coach, Mental Health Monitor) that collaborate to analyze multimodal inputs.
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** Implementing a pipeline to retrieve private, domain-specific health knowledge, ensuring recommendations are accurate and grounded in verified data.
- **Multimodal CV & NLP:** Using YOLOv11 for food recognition, MediaPipe for posture analysis, and Whisper/RoBERTa for voice interactions and sentiment analysis.
- **Predictive Analytics:** Utilizing LSTM or Prophet to forecast health trends based on historical data.

**Tech Stack:**
Our planned stack includes **PyTorch/Hugging Face** for core models, **LangChain or AutoGen** for agent orchestration, and a vector database (such as **Pinecone or FAISS**) for the RAG component. The final solution will be deployed via **Streamlit or GCP**.

**Feasibility & Guidance:**
We recognize that incorporating Multi-Agent systems and RAG involves a steep learning curve and goes beyond standard curriculum topics. **We are fully prepared to research and self-study these advanced frameworks.** However, given the breadth of features proposed (CV, NLP, and Predictive Analytics), we would appreciate your feedback on the **project scope**.

Do you think this scope is manageable for the semester timeline, or would you recommend prioritizing specific components (e.g., focusing primarily on RAG and Agents first) to ensure a successful delivery?

Thank you for your time and guidance.

Best regards,

**Group 5**
