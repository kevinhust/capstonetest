**Subject:** Proposal for Capstone Project: Mutiple Agentic AI Health Butler **Node Health** - Group 5

**Dear Professor Amit,**

We are **Group 5** (Aziz, Wangchuk, Mingxuan, Zhihuai) from the AI Capstone course. We are writing to formally propose a custom project idea: **Node Health**

We have designed this project to address the common problem of "generic health advice" by building a deeply personalized, **Multi-Agent AI** system that integrates Computer Vision and RAG.

**Project Overview (MVP Scope):**
Our goal is to build an intelligent nutrition and fitness assistant that users can interact with naturally. The core workflow is:

1.  **Snap & Analyze**: User uploads a meal photo -> **AI Nutritionist Agent** (powered by **YOLO26**) detects food items and estimates calories/macros.
2.  **Verify**: The specific food data is cross-referenced with a **RAG Knowledge Base** (USDA/WHO data) to ensure accuracy.
3.  **Advise**: A **Coordinator Agent** synthesizes this analysis with the user's goals to provide instant, evidence-based dietary feedbacks and simple exercise suggestions (via a **Fitness Agent**).

**Technical Innovation & 2026 Tech Stack:**
To ensure this meets Capstone rigor, we are aggressively adopting 2026 industry standards:

-   **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Using **LangGraph** to manage the cyclic workflow between diverse agents (Nutrition, Fitness, Coordinator).
-   **Computer Vision**: Fine-tuning **YOLO26** (latest edge-optimized model) on the Food-101 dataset for real-time food recognition.
-   **RAG Pipeline**: Using **FAISS** vector store with high-precision **e5-large** embeddings to retrieve trusted health protocols, strictly eliminating LLM hallucinations.
-   **LLM Intelligence**: leveraging **Gemini 2.5 Flash** for high-speed, cost-effective reasoning.
-   **Deployment**: A full containerized deployment on **GCP Cloud Run**.

**Feasibility:**
We have focused the scope specifically on **Nutrition & Diet** (excluding broad medical diagnosis) to ensuring we can deliver a high-quality, polished MVP within the 14-week timeline. We have structured the development into modular components (Data, CV, Agents, UI) to allow our 4-person team to work in parallel.

We believe this project combines sufficient technical complexity (Vision + NLP + Agents) with a realistic scope for a successful delivery.

**Request for Guidance:**
We recognize that the Multi-Agent orchestration and robust RAG implementation are advanced topics. While we are prepared to study the documentation and implement these independently, could you let us know if upcoming lectures will touch on design patterns for LangGraph or Agentic workflows? This will help us plan our self-study roadmap accordingly.

We look forward to your approval and guidance.

Best regards,

**Group 5**
